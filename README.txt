Breakout
currently having issues determining bounce detection. I thinks what I should do is have all blocks have a topUnits, bottomUnits... etc. And then create a disposable copy of the ball for checking bounces.

I dont know. Maybe not worth it. I need to pick an open source game engine and start using it. Small projects like this except with tutorials and specific goals.
